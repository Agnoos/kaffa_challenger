## Desafio Kaffa Mobile

Initially, it will be necessary to have a package manager on your computer, it can be npm or yarn, as soon as you clone the repository, start the installation script at the root of the project, "yarn install" or "npm i".

Thus the dependencies will be installed, there is no library of styles or validation functions, there is only the scope in typescript of React.

It is now possible to start the project on your localhost with the tag: "npm start" or "yarn start"

## Static deploy

The Repository will also be online at: https://youthful-volhard-fdaa13.netlify.app/

However, as it is a free hosting, it is not possible to make requests to servers, and therefore, some system features will not work.
